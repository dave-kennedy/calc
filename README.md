# calc

This is a basic interactive calculator. It can do addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division with two operands at a time. If you leave out the
first operand, it will use the result of the previous calculation.

To build the thing, just do:

```sh
$ make
```

To build and run the tests, do:

```sh
$ make test
$ ./test
```
